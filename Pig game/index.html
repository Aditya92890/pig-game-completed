        <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
        <li>
          In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each
          result get added to his ROUND score.
        </li>
        <li>
          BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After
          that, it's the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets
          added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
